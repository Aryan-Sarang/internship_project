flask


1. display top 5 tokens with most no of orders
2. display top 5 tokens with higest volume
3. edit the ui to show one graph at a time but user can change what graph they want to see with the help of a dropdown menu or a navigation bar

4. next graph is x axis pe we will have every unique token and on y axis we will have the total no of entries/quantity displayed
   in a descending order 

5. add some frontend stuff like carousels, navigation buttons in the carousels, add plotly instead of 
   matplotlib

6. make an api of our backend to fetch the data that we are displaying in the graphs but in json format
   and then use that api in the frontend to display the data as text output(i think idk)
